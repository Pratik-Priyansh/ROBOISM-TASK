# ROBOISM-TASK

In the problem statement we were given an image named CVtask which contains boxes of different shapes and of different colours. We were also given four aruco markers of different unspecified ids. We had to detect the square boxes from the given image named CVtask and we had to overlap aruco markers with those boxes with proper orientation. It was given to us that the particular colour square box should be overlapped with a particular id aruco marker. We had to overlap the aruco markers with the square boxes with proper orientation and ids .

These are the additional projects that were given:
